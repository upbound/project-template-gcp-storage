# This test suite validates the creation of resources for the XStorageBucket XR.
#
# Creation of resources happens in two sequential calls to the composition
# function:
#
# 1. The first time the function is called, the bucket has not yet been
#    created. The ACL resource depends on the bucket's name, so the function
#    creates only the bucket.
#
# 2. When the function is called again after the bucket has been created, its
#    name is available, so the ACL can also be created.
#
# The test suite contains two tests, one for each of the sequential calls. The
# second test includes the bucket in its observed resources, triggering creation
# of the dependent resources.
